The material shown here is relevant to both the Summer 2020 and Summer 2021 offerings of the class; any year 2020 material listed here is being reused in the 2021 version of the calss, and will probably work in versions of Unity from 2019.4 up to 2021.1 (and hopefully later, but who knows). Some minor tweaking may be needed.
